"I was a sales personssenl  for three years. I spent every day working with a diverse population of people in a stressful, fast-paced environment, so even before I started working as a developer, I was already a pro at juggling the empathy, communication, and work ethic needed to succeed in the dev world. 


"Hi,  I'm Jesse, and my biggest goal in life is to use software engineering to help environmental organizations change the world, one line of code at a time."
"I'm currently completing coursework at Microverse, a remote software development that allows devs from all over the world to pair-program and build projects together.
"I've spent the last several months working on a number of projects: landing pages, APIs, and a  logistic delivery app for a local restaurant startup . I'm in the top 1% of active GitHub users in my country, which is a small brag but something I'm really proud of.
"I've spent the last several months working remotely and asynchronously with people across five different time zones, so when I read your post on LinkedIn about fintech company  looking for experienced remote devs, I immediately saw myself in the job description."
"I'd love to schedule a 15-minute Zoom call to talk about the frontend role avaliable . Would you have some time next week?"
