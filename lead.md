 "Hi,  I'm Jesse, a full-stack developer.
One of my goals is to mentor and teach people interested in software development and change the world one line of code at a time.I'm currently completing coursework at Microverse,
an online software development company where international devs pair-program and build projects together.
"I've spent the last several months working on several projects and working
remotely and asynchronously with people across five different time zones,learning about the right way to communicate, we built
landing pages, APIs, and a  blockchain marketplace with javascript,react and ruby and also solidity.
i am a pragmatic programmer who loves problem solving.  
I'm in the top 1% of active GitHub users in my country,  and I own an online school where I teach people how to code, a small brag but one I'm proud about.
When I read your post on LinkedIn about  looking for experienced remote devs,
 I immediately saw myself in the job description because i always used your application for mobile trading"
I'd love to schedule a 15-minute Zoom call to discuss the open front-end role.
Would you have some time next week?"
